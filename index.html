      <h3>About Me!</h3>
      <p>My name is Rhett Schnitkey. I like monkeys so much! I have two brothers (Brentley, Grayson) and two sisters (Brynn, Renee). I am 12 years old and Brently is eight years old. Grayson is four years old. Brynn is 15 years old and she is the oldest kid. Renee is my twin sister, which means she is 12, like me! </p>
      <p>I live in Napoleon, Ohio. I go to school at Napoleon Junior High School.</p>
      <p>My favorite sports are cross country, soccer, track, and football. My favorite teams are Cleveland Indians, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Ohio State Buckeyes.</p>
      <p>I have one pet. I have a dog named Nayla. I had a guinea pig named Mac, which was short for macaroni. He was a really cute guinea pig, but unfortunately he died. </p>
      <p>I had a great dog named Bucky, who lived to be 15 years old in human years! But sadly, we had to put him down.</p>
      <p>When I grow up, I want to be a farmer. And I want to have monkeys when I grow up!</p>
