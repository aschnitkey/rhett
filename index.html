      <h3>About Me!</h3>
      <p>My name is Rhett Schnitkey. I like monkeys so much! I have two brothers (Brentley, Grayson) and two sisters (Brynn, Renee). I am ten years old and Brently is six years old. Grayson is two years old. Brynn is 13 years old and she is the oldest kid. Renee is my twin sister, which means she is ten, like me! </p>
      <p>I live in Napoleon, Ohio. I go to school at Napoleon Elementary.</p>
      <p>My favorite sports are cross country, soccer, baseball, basketball, and football. My favorite teams are Clevevland Indians, Cleveland Cavaliers,Cleveland Browns, and Ohio State Buckeyes.</p>
      <p>I have two pets. I have a dog named Nayla and another dog named Bucky. I had a guinea pig named Mac, which was short for macaroni. He was a really cute guinea pig, but unfortunately he died. </p>
      <p>When I grow up, I want to be an engineer. And I want to have monkeys when I grow up!</p>
