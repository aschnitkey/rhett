    #about
      h3 About Me!
      p My name is Rhett Schnitkey. I like monkeys so much! I have two brothers (Brentley, Grayson) and two sisters (Brynn, Renee). I am nine years old and Brently is five years old. Grayson is 17 months old. Brynn is 12 years old and she is the oldest kid. Renee is my twin sister, which means she is nine, like me! 
      p I live in Napoleon, Ohio. I go to school at Napoleon Elementary.
      p My favorite sports are cross country, soccer, baseball, basketball, and football. My favorite teams are Clevevland Indians, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Ohio State Buckeyes.
      p I have two pets. I have a dog named Nayla and another dog named Bucky. I had a guinea pig named Mac, which was short for macaroni. He was a really cute guinea pig, but unfortunately he died. 
      p When I grow up, I want to be an engineer. And I want to have monkeys when I grow up!

        p My parents are Aaron and Miranda. They are the best parents in the whole, wide world! Miranda helps me pick out my clothes. Miranda taught me how to pick up stuff with my toes. And my dad makes stuff for us like our trampoline and he is the best dad!
        p My grandma and grandpa names are Connie and Dave. And John and Sue. My uncle's name is Andrew (and he's the one who made this website for me!). My other uncle's name is Craig and my aunt's name is Aunt Emily. My cousins are Chloe, Selah, and Josie.
